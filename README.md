# Monthly-Sales-Forecasting-with-ARIMA-Models
Monthly Sales Forecasting with ARIMA Models" is a guide to predicting sales trends using historical data through ARIMA techniques. This project covers data preparation, analysis, and model application, ideal for analysts and strategists aiming to improve decision-making with time series forecasting.


# Forecasting with ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA

The [Jupyter notebook]() provides a comprehensive guide to forecasting using ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA models. It is designed to walk through the process of analyzing monthly sales data, from data cleaning to final predictions.

## Overview

- **ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA**: Introduction to the forecasting models used in this notebook.
- **Monthly Sales Data**: The dataset used for forecasting.
- **Data Cleaning**: Preparing the data for analysis, including converting string date formats to datetime objects for ease of handling in time series analysis.

## Getting Started

To run this notebook:

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed.
2. Install necessary Python packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `statsmodels`, `pmdarima`.
3. Download the notebook and the monthly sales data file.
4. Open the notebook in Jupyter and run the cells sequentially.

## Data

The dataset used in this project represents monthly sales. It is crucial that the date column is formatted correctly for time series analysis. The notebook will guide you through the process of data cleaning and preparation.

## Models Covered

- **ARIMA**: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model for understanding and predicting future points in the series.
- **Seasonal ARIMA**: An extension of ARIMA that supports univariate time series data with a seasonal component.

## Usage

Follow the instructions and code cells step-by-step to understand the methodology behind ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA forecasting. The notebook includes:

- Data visualization
- Model fitting
- Predictions and forecasting
- Model evaluation
